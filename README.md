### InstaMail

This is a very basic iOS app from an example in the "Head first iOS
development" book.

It features a UIPicker that has two columns with actions and feelings. The user
can select one from each and it will generate a message along the lines of "I'm
_action_ and I'm feeling _feeling_ about it!". You can also specify a note to
prepend to the message. The message is printed to console with NSLog
